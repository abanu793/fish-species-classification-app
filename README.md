# Fish Species Classification
This repository contains a **CNN-based model** for classifying different species of fish from images.

# Project Overview

- **Objective:** Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify fish images into different species.
- **Model:** `cnn_best_model.h5` (stored using Git LFS due to large size)
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit (for web app)

- Classify fish images into species accurately.
- User-friendly web app for real-time predictions using Streamlit.
- Pre-trained CNN model with high accuracy (~98.4%).
